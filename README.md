I have worked on Antenatal(ANC) module only.

Antenatal(ANC) module file path:
.
└── src/
    └── pages/
        └── anc-referrals/
            ├── encounter
            └── index

And I have added some things to other files as needed to work, such as: 

* adding routing, 
* adding some objects to the modal-types.ts file to open modal, 
* adding some custom classes in index.css file to facilitate the design, 
* create a encounter-form-layout use previous code 
* Added some features to some form components
* added some route in application-router.tsx file for antanatal encounter form
* added module-route.tsx file a route for antanatal index file
* And added some necessary components I did them in my template file.
template file path: 
.
└── src/
    └── pages/
        └── anc-referrals/
            └── encounter/
                └── form-tamplate

The files outside of my module have comments attached to the work I have done.
